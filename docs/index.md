About
-----

The above image shows an ensemble-based statistical forecast of water
elevation difference between two sites in the [Indian River Lagoon
(IRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_River_Lagoon). Model data
are provided by the [Global Ensemble Forecast System
(GEFS)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-ensemble-forecast-system-gefs)
and are verified with wind observations from [Orlando Melbourne
International Airport
(KMLB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Melbourne_International_Airport).
The statistical model is calibrated to over fifty significant setup
events during the winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 (see [Colvin et al.
2017]()).
